Description: The PKADVAN package is an R package for simulating pharmacokinetic data based on various pharmacokinetic models. The package uses the ADVAN-style analytical solutions for 26 different pharmacokinetic models to simulate pharmacokinetic data. The PKADVAN functions allow for simulating arbitrary dosing regimens and acounts for changes in covariate/parameter values that may occur at discrete times within and/or between dosing intervals. The ADVAN-style analytical solutions were successfully validated against NONMEM outputs. The ADVAN-style analytical functions presented herein overcome obstacles to implementing the classical analytical solutions in software, and have speed advantages over solutions using differential equation solvers and, therefore, can be applied for simulation from stochastic population pharmacokinetic models coded in R and incorporated into reactive Shiny Web applications. The speed of the PKADVAN functions allows for simulating larger populations without compromising the reactivity benefits of the Shiny application .
