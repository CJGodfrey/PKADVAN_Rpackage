Description: This package presents the ADVAN-style analytical solutions for
    1, 2, and 3 compartments IV bolus, infusion, and first-order absoprtion
    pharmacokinetic models for simulating pharmacokinetic data. The package allows
    for simulating arbitrary dosing regimens and acounts for changes in covariate/
    parameter values that may occur at discrete times within and/or between dosing
    intervals.The ADVAN-style analytical solutions were successfully validated
    against NONMEM outputs. The ADVAN-style analytical solutions presented in this
    package overcome obstacles to implementing the classical analytical solutions
    in software, and have speed advantages over solutions using differential
    equation solvers and, therefore, can be applied for simulation from stochastic
    population pharmacokinetic models coded in R and incorporated into reactive
    Shiny Web applications as they allow for simulating larger populations (e.g.
    1000 subjects) without compromising the speed and the reactivity benefits of the
    Shiny application .
